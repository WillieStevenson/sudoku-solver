# sudoku-solver
An under 100 line sudoku solver in Python

I wrote this script for the purpose of writing and experimenting with the recursive backtracking algorithm - as this solver utilizes this.

## Run

1. Download the script and the attached test sudoku puzzle to see the valid puzzle format.
2. Link either a newly created puzzle or just run the default one.
3. Run `$ python solver.py`
